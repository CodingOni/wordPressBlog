										<p>Bali, has been calling my name for years now. There was something about this picturesque, spiritual looking place that I knew I had to explore. I sold my usual travel buddy, E on it and this year we finally made it happen. As I told friends and coworkers about my intended visit to this far away land they all oozed with envy, some recounting stories of their own visits. I heard tales of sunrise treks up volcanoes and $4(USD) massages. I could not wait.</p>

With all of the exotic or faraway places I could choose to add to the list, one might think “why Toronto?” I’m not sure when I heard about Caribana, Toronto’s annual Caribbean carnival, but I heard that it was North America's largest carnival festival.</p>

												<p>I recently had the pleasure of completing Kevin Hart’s audiobook, I Can’t Make This Up: Life Lessons. Before I get into this review let me start with the following disclaimer: I am biased, outlandishly so. I absolutely adore Kevin Hart and his brand of comedy and if you ask me, it’s almost as if he could do no wrong. </p>

												<p>Have you ever wondered what makes people stick it out? Why is it that some people are seemingly unaffected by failures and or obstacles? What is the super power that urges someone to dust themselves off and keep going in circumstances where most of us would likely call it quits? Well, the super power isn’t much of a super power after all. According to author Angela Duckworth, it all boils down to a character trait called grit.</p>

                      <p>Bali, has been calling my name for years now. There was something about this picturesque, spiritual looking place that I knew I had to explore. I sold my usual travel buddy, E on it and this year we finally made it happen. As I told friends and coworkers about my intended visit to this far away land they all oozed with envy, some recounting stories of their own visits. I heard tales of sunrise treks up volcanoes and $4(USD) massages. I could not wait.</p>

<p>About a week prior to our trip, while in Toronto for Caribana, a friend sent me a news link about a deadly earthquake on Lombok Island in Indonesia, Bali’s large neighboring island to the east. I started to think maybe I just had bad luck when it came to vacationing. I can literally recount a hospitalization, a death in the family, back-to-back hurricanes and a terrorist attack happening days or mere hours before major vacations. One of those actually happened during the actual trip (2 hurricanes barreled towards Hawaii narrowly missing us in the end).</p>

<p>As death tolls began to rise, we were rattled and unsure of what to do. After some research we discovered that Bali is located in what’s known as the Ring of Fire (WTF), a name it acquired because of the prevalence of volcanoes and fault lines. Sooo... in Indonesia earthquakes are just a thing I guess. In light of this discovery and the recent uptick in fault activity, E and I decided to not risk it and cancel Bali. Maybe we could go to Greece instead. We’d purchased travel insurance so we assumed this would be easy. Wrong. There were no US travel restrictions or advisories placed on Bali and the Balinese government had deemed Bali safe for travel so refunds for our tickets were a no-go. What would we do? “I guess we’re going to Bali” said E and that’s what we did.</p>

<p>I flew into New York to meet with E and we flew out of JFK on EVA air. I loathe long flights so I prepared for the worst. Surprisingly, our 30-hour flight wasn’t that bad. Service was great and we lucked out with comfortable seats with plenty of legroom. I slept for a good majority of the first leg of the trip. Even our 5-layover in Taipei Taiwan went by pretty smoothly. Taipei’s airport is probably the coolest airport I’ve ever been in. Each terminal decked out in its own unique theme made the building seem more like a museum than a travel hub.</p>

<p>We landed in Bali around 3pm and were immediately awed by Denpasar airport, which resembled an Asian botanical garden. We were greeted by our hotel rep and set off to Poppies, our hotel in Kuta. This would be the first village stop on our stay. On the trek to the hotel I realized that Bali was more than the picturesque rice fields and temples I regularly saw on the web and Instagram. It was a real place with real indigenous people living real lives. Simple and sometimes rundown buildings were home to bare minimum storefronts and homes. Stray dogs roamed the streets and scores of mopeds zigzagged through congested traffic. It was loud, bustling and chaotic. As we got closer to our hotel it became touristier. Eateries, hotels and shops with American brands like Nike in the window were visible but the gritty realness of the village couldn’t be completely masked. These were simple people and it almost felt like we (tourists) were intruding.</p>

<p>Our hotel was hidden down a narrow street that was barely wide enough for mopeds but even cars defiantly squeezed through with little regard for pedestrians. We quickly learned that walking in Bali meant move or be moved. It was raining as we checked into our hotel, which was made up of several cottages and a covered outdoor reception area. We figured we would get washed up, take a nap and head out for dinner. We stuck to the first part of the plan but our bodies missed the memo on part two. When we awakened and realized it was pouring outside and that we weren’t all that hungry we decided to stay in bed and chalked up our first night in Bali to enjoying our cute little cottage and getting some much needed rest.</p>

<p>We had a full day of activities planned the next day. Breakfast, a trek down to Nusa Dua for water activities, a visit cliff side to the Uluwatu Temple and sunset dance, followed by dinner. We had a glutinous breakfast at this cute little café where the fresh, mixed juice was to die for. We ordered fresh juice almost everywhere we went after that.</p>
                      <p>Veering from plan we decided to do a little wandering. We walked in and out of local shops, wandered onto to the beach and even stopped so E could get a henna tattoo. We headed back to our hotel and hired a diver to Nusa Dua. On the drive we saw a structure that seemed to tower over the island. Turns out it’s one of the biggest monuments in the world. Located at Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park, the giant statue of Hindu God Vishnu is depicted riding a Garuda mystical bird. The statue, 28 years in the making, apparently had just been completed this April. Our diver mentioned we could stop by on our return. Vishnu stands approximately 396 ft. high. For perspective, the Statue of Liberty is approximately 305 ft. high. We ran long at the activity center and didn’t get a chance to go back, which in retrospect was a shame. Much like Christ the Redeemer in Brazil or the Statue of Liberty in New York, It seems like a spectacular, cultural must-see.</p>
                      <p> We arrived at the activity center and after some indecisiveness decided on the water jet bike and underwater sea walking. I absolutely sucked at the water bike. I could barely get off the water and when I fell, I fell hard, but the few times I did manage to get off the water, it was exhilarating. E fared much better and had a good time laughing at me. </p>

                  <p>Next we headed off with two employees on a small motorboat equipped with a single life vest (I held on extra tight) and arrived at a stationed boat further out in the water. They gave us a few instructions and down we went. Not gonna lie I was a bit scared but once I climbed down the ladder I was at ease, fully immersed in the beauty of the sea. From the coral to the fish and the underwater statues, it was a great experience. We headed back and got cleaned up and waited while they put our pictures on a CD. By the time we got back in the car and set off again it was already late and traffic was crazy. Our driver told us the sun would be setting in a few minutes and we would miss the sunset at Uluwatu Temple. That was a huge bummer for me, I really wanted to visit that temple and in retrospect would have made sure to spend a little less time wandering aimlessly through Kuta. We decided to just go straight to dinner. For dinner we visited Jimbaran Bay, which we heard was great for seafood. Jimbaran is all about ambiance. Candle-lit tables stretched out across the beach as far as the eye could see. Several restaurants featured live music and performances. I ordered a fried salmon and I forget what type of grilled fish E ordered but we each got these massive whole fish. E was not so impressed by her dish but mine was delicious.</p>
                  <p>After dinner we headed back to our hotel to call it a night. However, for some reason we were wired. We decided to head out and see if any of those 4-dollar massage places were open (it was after 10:30pm). After a couple of unsuccessful attempts, we decided to walk down another busy looking street and voila we found an open spot. 1 hour massage 60,000 rupiah. Perfect! We got great massages and headed back to our room.</p>

                <p>  The next morning our driver from our next hotel picked us up bright and early. On the way, we spotted a large group of men running and inquired about what they were doing and he said some fighting training. I thought he asked us if we had ever attended a fight and mentioned stopping to see one. When I realized we were ahead of schedule, I said why not. What he ended up taking us to was temple where we stopped to take photos and attended a live play-like performance. We took in some of the show but realized if we stayed much longer we would not make it to the hotel on schedule to meet our next driver. We found our driver (he was doing some “window shopping at an adjacent market) and continued on to our hotel.</p>
                <p>We were shown to our “room” (That’s in quotations because room was an understatement). The structure we stayed in was more like a 2-floor cottage crafted in a beautiful dark wood. The exterior of the first floor featured a patio with dinning table and lounge chairs. The interior could serve as a living room or sleeping quarters for two with its own bathroom and sink area. Upstairs was the master bedroom, beautifully designed as well with a white mosquito net draped romantically over the bed.

</p><p>As we chatted and got our things in order in our room before heading out with our driver something happened. All of the sudden our cottage moved. Yes I said it moved. It wasn’t so much as a tremble it was more of a quick sway almost as if a tremendously strong gust of wind was pushing to and fro. “What the fuck is that?” I thought to myself. </p>

What would we do? “I guess we’re going to Bali” said E and that’s what we did.</p>

    <p>I flew into New York to meet with E and we flew out of JFK on EVA air. I loathe long flights so I prepared for the worst. Surprisingly, our 30-hour flight wasn’t that bad. Service was great and we lucked out with comfortable seats with plenty of legroom. I slept for a good majority of the first leg of the trip. Even our 5-layover in Taipei Taiwan went by pretty smoothly. Taipei’s airport is probably the coolest airport I’ve ever been in. Each terminal decked out in its own unique theme made the building seem more like a museum than a travel hub.</p>

    <p>We landed in Bali around 3pm and were immediately awed by Denpasar airport, which resembled an Asian botanical garden. We were greeted by our hotel rep and set off to Poppies, our hotel in Kuta. This would be the first village stop on our stay. On the trek to the hotel I realized that Bali was more than the picturesque rice fields and temples I regularly saw on the web and Instagram. It was a real place with real indigenous people living real lives. Simple and sometimes rundown buildings were home to bare minimum storefronts and homes. Stray dogs roamed the streets and scores of mopeds zigzagged through congested traffic. It was loud, bustling and chaotic. As we got closer to our hotel it became touristier. Eateries, hotels and shops with American brands like Nike in the window were visible but the gritty realness of the village couldn’t be completely masked. These were simple people and it almost felt like we (tourists) were intruding.</p>

    <p>Our hotel was hidden down a narrow street that was barely wide enough for mopeds but even cars defiantly squeezed through with little regard for pedestrians. We quickly learned that walking in Bali meant move or be moved. It was raining as we checked into our hotel, which was made up of several cottages and a covered outdoor reception area. We figured we would get washed up, take a nap and head out for dinner. We stuck to the first part of the plan but our bodies missed the memo on part two. When we awakened and realized it was pouring outside and that we weren’t all that hungry we decided to stay in bed and chalked up our first night in Bali to enjoying our cute little cottage and getting some much needed rest.</p>

    <p>We had a full day of activities planned the next day. Breakfast, a trek down to Nusa Dua for water activities, a visit cliff side to the Uluwatu Temple and sunset dance, followed by dinner. We had a glutinous breakfast at this cute little café where the fresh, mixed juice was to die for. We ordered fresh juice almost everywhere we went after that.</p>
                          <p>Veering from plan we decided to do a little wandering. We walked in and out of local shops, wandered onto to the beach and even stopped so E could get a henna tattoo. We headed back to our hotel and hired a diver to Nusa Dua. On the drive we saw a structure that seemed to tower over the island. Turns out it’s one of the biggest monuments in the world. Located at Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park, the giant statue of Hindu God Vishnu is depicted riding a Garuda mystical bird. The statue, 28 years in the making, apparently had just been completed this April. Our diver mentioned we could stop by on our return. Vishnu stands approximately 396 ft. high. For perspective, the Statue of Liberty is approximately 305 ft. high. We ran long at the activity center and didn’t get a chance to go back, which in retrospect was a shame. Much like Christ the Redeemer in Brazil or the Statue of Liberty in New York, It seems like a spectacular, cultural must-see.</p>
                          <p> We arrived at the activity center and after some indecisiveness decided on the water jet bike and underwater sea walking. I absolutely sucked at the water bike. I could barely get off the water and when I fell, I fell hard, but the few times I did manage to get off the water, it was exhilarating. E fared much better and had a good time laughing at me. </p>

                      <p>Next we headed off with two employees on a small motorboat equipped with a single life vest (I held on extra tight) and arrived at a stationed boat further out in the water. They gave us a few instructions and down we went. Not gonna lie I was a bit scared but once I climbed down the ladder I was at ease, fully immersed in the beauty of the sea. From the coral to the fish and the underwater statues, it was a great experience. We headed back and got cleaned up and waited while they put our pictures on a CD. By the time we got back in the car and set off again it was already late and traffic was crazy. Our driver told us the sun would be setting in a few minutes and we would miss the sunset at Uluwatu Temple. That was a huge bummer for me, I really wanted to visit that temple and in retrospect would have made sure to spend a little less time wandering aimlessly through Kuta. We decided to just go straight to dinner. For dinner we visited Jimbaran Bay, which we heard was great for seafood. Jimbaran is all about ambiance. Candle-lit tables stretched out across the beach as far as the eye could see. Several restaurants featured live music and performances. I ordered a fried salmon and I forget what type of grilled fish E ordered but we each got these massive whole fish. E was not so impressed by her dish but mine was delicious.</p>
                      <p>After dinner we headed back to our hotel to call it a night. However, for some reason we were wired. We decided to head out and see if any of those 4-dollar massage places were open (it was after 10:30pm). After a couple of unsuccessful attempts, we decided to walk down another busy looking street and voila we found an open spot. 1 hour massage 60,000 rupiah. Perfect! We got great massages and headed back to our room.</p>

                    <p>  The next morning our driver from our next hotel picked us up bright and early. On the way, we spotted a large group of men running and inquired about what they were doing and he said some fighting training. I thought he asked us if we had ever attended a fight and mentioned stopping to see one. When I realized we were ahead of schedule, I said why not. What he ended up taking us to was temple where we stopped to take photos and attended a live play-like performance. We took in some of the show but realized if we stayed much longer we would not make it to the hotel on schedule to meet our next driver. We found our driver (he was doing some “window shopping at an adjacent market) and continued on to our hotel.</p>
                    <p>We were shown to our “room” (That’s in quotations because room was an understatement). The structure we stayed in was more like a 2-floor cottage crafted in a beautiful dark wood. The exterior of the first floor featured a patio with dinning table and lounge chairs. The interior could serve as a living room or sleeping quarters for two with its own bathroom and sink area. Upstairs was the master bedroom, beautifully designed as well with a white mosquito net draped romantically over the bed.

    </p><p>As we chatted and got our things in order in our room before heading out with our driver something happened. All of the sudden our cottage moved. Yes I said it moved. It wasn’t so much as a tremble it was more of a quick sway almost as if a tremendously strong gust of wind was pushing to and fro. “What the fuck is that?” I thought to myself. </p>
    <p>Bali, has been calling my name for years now. There was something about this picturesque, spiritual looking place that I knew I had to explore. I sold my usual travel buddy, E on it and this year we finally made it happen. As I told friends and coworkers about my intended visit to this far away land they all oozed with envy, some recounting stories of their own visits. I heard tales of sunrise treks up volcanoes and $4(USD) massages. I could not wait.</p>

<p>About a week prior to our trip, while in Toronto for Caribana, a friend sent me a news link about a deadly earthquake on Lombok Island in Indonesia, Bali’s large neighboring island to the east. I started to think maybe I just had bad luck when it came to vacationing. I can literally recount a hospitalization, a death in the family, back-to-back hurricanes and a terrorist attack happening days or mere hours before major vacations. One of those actually happened during the actual trip (2 hurricanes barreled towards Hawaii narrowly missing us in the end).</p>

<p>As death tolls began to rise, we were rattled and unsure of what to do. After some research we discovered that Bali is located in what’s known as the Ring of Fire (WTF), a name it acquired because of the prevalence of volcanoes and fault lines. Sooo... in Indonesia earthquakes are just a thing I guess. In light of this discovery and the recent uptick in fault activity, E and I decided to not risk it and cancel Bali. Maybe we could go to Greece instead. We’d purchased travel insurance so we assumed this would be easy. Wrong. There were no US travel restrictions or advisories placed on Bali and the Balinese government had deemed Bali safe for travel so refunds for our tickets were a no-go.

        <p>I flew into New York to meet with E and we flew out of JFK on EVA air. I loathe long flights so I prepared for the worst. Surprisingly, our 30-hour flight wasn’t that bad. Service was great and we lucked out with comfortable seats with plenty of legroom. I slept for a good majority of the first leg of the trip. Even our 5-layover in Taipei Taiwan went by pretty smoothly. Taipei’s airport is probably the coolest airport I’ve ever been in. Each terminal decked out in its own unique theme made the building seem more like a museum than a travel hub.</p>

        <p>We landed in Bali around 3pm and were immediately awed by Denpasar airport, which resembled an Asian botanical garden. We were greeted by our hotel rep and set off to Poppies, our hotel in Kuta. This would be the first village stop on our stay. On the trek to the hotel I realized that Bali was more than the picturesque rice fields and temples I regularly saw on the web and Instagram. It was a real place with real indigenous people living real lives. Simple and sometimes rundown buildings were home to bare minimum storefronts and homes. Stray dogs roamed the streets and scores of mopeds zigzagged through congested traffic. It was loud, bustling and chaotic. As we got closer to our hotel it became touristier. Eateries, hotels and shops with American brands like Nike in the window were visible but the gritty realness of the village couldn’t be completely masked. These were simple people and it almost felt like we (tourists) were intruding.</p>

        <p>Our hotel was hidden down a narrow street that was barely wide enough for mopeds but even cars defiantly squeezed through with little regard for pedestrians. We quickly learned that walking in Bali meant move or be moved. It was raining as we checked into our hotel, which was made up of several cottages and a covered outdoor reception area. We figured we would get washed up, take a nap and head out for dinner. We stuck to the first part of the plan but our bodies missed the memo on part two. When we awakened and realized it was pouring outside and that we weren’t all that hungry we decided to stay in bed and chalked up our first night in Bali to enjoying our cute little cottage and getting some much needed rest.</p>

        <p>We had a full day of activities planned the next day. Breakfast, a trek down to Nusa Dua for water activities, a visit cliff side to the Uluwatu Temple and sunset dance, followed by dinner. We had a glutinous breakfast at this cute little café where the fresh, mixed juice was to die for. We ordered fresh juice almost everywhere we went after that.</p>
            <p>Veering from plan we decided to do a little wandering. We walked in and out of local shops, wandered onto to the beach and even stopped so E could get a henna tattoo. We headed back to our hotel and hired a diver to Nusa Dua. On the drive we saw a structure that seemed to tower over the island. Turns out it’s one of the biggest monuments in the world. Located at Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park, the giant statue of Hindu God Vishnu is depicted riding a Garuda mystical bird. The statue, 28 years in the making, apparently had just been completed this April. Our diver mentioned we could stop by on our return. Vishnu stands approximately 396 ft. high. For perspective, the Statue of Liberty is approximately 305 ft. high. We ran long at the activity center and didn’t get a chance to go back, which in retrospect was a shame. Much like Christ the Redeemer in Brazil or the Statue of Liberty in New York, It seems like a spectacular, cultural must-see.</p>
            <p> We arrived at the activity center and after some indecisiveness decided on the water jet bike and underwater sea walking. I absolutely sucked at the water bike. I could barely get off the water and when I fell, I fell hard, but the few times I did manage to get off the water, it was exhilarating. E fared much better and had a good time laughing at me. </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p class="mb-0">MCSE boot camps have its supporters and its detractors. Some people do not understand why you should have to spend money on boot camp when you can get the MCSE study materials yourself at a fraction of the camp price. However, who has the willpower to actually sit through a self-imposed MCSE training.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Next we headed off with two employees on a small motorboat equipped with a single life vest (I held on extra tight) and arrived at a stationed boat further out in the water. They gave us a few instructions and down we went. Not gonna lie I was a bit scared but once I climbed down the ladder I was at ease, fully immersed in the beauty of the sea. From the coral to the fish and the underwater statues, it was a great experience. We headed back and got cleaned up and waited while they put our pictures on a CD. By the time we got back in the car and set off again it was already late and traffic was crazy. Our driver told us the sun would be setting in a few minutes and we would miss the sunset at Uluwatu Temple. That was a huge bummer for me, I really wanted to visit that temple and in retrospect would have made sure to spend a little less time wandering aimlessly through Kuta. We decided to just go straight to dinner. For dinner we visited Jimbaran Bay, which we heard was great for seafood. Jimbaran is all about ambiance. Candle-lit tables stretched out across the beach as far as the eye could see. Several restaurants featured live music and performances. I ordered a fried salmon and I forget what type of grilled fish E ordered but we each got these massive whole fish. E was not so impressed by her dish but mine was delicious.</p>
        <p>After dinner we headed back to our hotel to call it a night. However, for some reason we were wired. We decided to head out and see if any of those 4-dollar massage places were open (it was after 10:30pm). After a couple of unsuccessful attempts, we decided to walk down another busy looking street and voila we found an open spot. 1 hour massage 60,000 rupiah. Perfect! We got great massages and headed back to our room.</p>

        <p>  The next morning our driver from our next hotel picked us up bright and early. On the way, we spotted a large group of men running and inquired about what they were doing and he said some fighting training. I thought he asked us if we had ever attended a fight and mentioned stopping to see one. When I realized we were ahead of schedule, I said why not. What he ended up taking us to was temple where we stopped to take photos and attended a live play-like performance. We took in some of the show but realized if we stayed much longer we would not make it to the hotel on schedule to meet our next driver. We found our driver (he was doing some “window shopping at an adjacent market) and continued on to our hotel.</p>
        <p>We were shown to our “room” (That’s in quotations because room was an understatement). The structure we stayed in was more like a 2-floor cottage crafted in a beautiful dark wood. The exterior of the first floor featured a patio with dinning table and lounge chairs. The interior could serve as a living room or sleeping quarters for two with its own bathroom and sink area. Upstairs was the master bedroom, beautifully designed as well with a white mosquito net draped romantically over the bed.

        </p><p>As we chatted and got our things in order in our room before heading out with our driver something happened. All of the sudden our cottage moved. Yes I said it moved. It wasn’t so much as a tremble it was more of a quick sway almost as if a tremendously strong gust of wind was pushing to and fro. “What the fuck is that?” I thought to myself. </p>
